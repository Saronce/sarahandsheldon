# This is the life story of Sarah and Sheldon from birth until the summer of 2012.  #

It's kinda private, sorry. 
 
*We don't really care who reads it, or anything like that, its just that we are writting it for ourselves; not for anyone else. So I guess what I'm saying is it probably won't be very interesting to read or easy to understand if your name is not Sarah/Sheldon. 

I guess Esther should probably be included too... haha.
