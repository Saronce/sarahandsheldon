I didn't like the \r\nidea of just sending money or some other thoughtless \"thing\" and I was too lazy to think of a\r\nbetter gift.\r\n\r\nBut I stopped for a few seconds this morning and actually thought about it. I realized that I \r\nhave absolutely NO excuse for not giving you a present. Before now my excuse for putting myself \r\nabove you was that I was maintaining the identity of a terrible, mean, misunderstood brother. \r\nBut that is total bullshit. \r\n\r\nSo I have an idea for a gift. Its not really a normal \"gift\"; its more of like a bonding \r\neperience or a project for us to do together (don't worry not THAT project, haha). \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### **I was thinking that we could document our entire childhood; maybe all the way up until this summer?**\r\n\r\nI have started by scanning all the pictures we have here (well not ALL of them, yet. There \r\nare a lot!) and putting them on GitHub. I was thinking we could scan ALL of the photos from\r\nour childhood that exist; AND a lot, or all, of our artwork; and anything else that is relevant\r\n(for example we could take pictures of childhood toys... etc.) Pretty much we will create an\r\nonline record of _everything_ from our childhood. \r\n\r\nThat will obviously take a long time so while we are doing that we can also be writing\r\nabout our memories. We can write about each picture, each piece of art, each major event,\r\neach person we remember. We can write about our memories of each other. We can write about\r\nour internal conflicts and feelings throughout our childhood. We can write about the differences\r\nbetween the way we perceived event when we were little and how we now remember those events.\r\nIdeally we would write down **EVERY SINGLE LITTLE THING WE REMEMBER OR FEEL LIKE SAYING** about our childhood. Because we will be using computers and the internet there's really no need to edit or \r\ncut anything out.\r\n\r\nI think this will be a really good thing for both of us! I was wanting to write an autobiography\r\nof my childhood any ways...\r\nAnd I know that our future selves will definitely appreciate it (judging from how much I enjoy\r\nlooking at those old pictures even now)! _And maybe our kids too._\r\n\r\nWe could even turn it into a website if you wanted, it would not be hard. **And I will take care\r\nof all the technical computer stuff!** Also, if we decide that a website of some sort is a good idea I will pay for the domain name as part of this present.\r\n\r\nAlso I am really interested, as ever, in learning more about myself. I'm sure I've got a lot \r\nof really deep seated habits and beliefs that came from my childhood and I would really like \r\nto understand where they come from.\r\n\r\nAny ways, as you can see its not a normal gift. And its also kind of self centred. \r\nBut any ways I hope you like the idea!\r\n\r\nAnd I hope you don't mind the idea of it **all being completely public (cause if its on GitHub\r\nit will be)?** I don't really have a problem with anyone in the world reading my most intimate \r\nthoughts. Although, in reality, there are things that I am absolutely terrified of telling \r\nANYONE. But I think the world would be a great place if everyone shared everything with \r\neach other... so I am trying to break down those fears and insecurities in myself.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\n\r\nWell if you like the idea then please keep reading, I'll tell you how it will work, exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\n\r\n\r\nSo GitHub seems like the best way for us to work on this together. Don't worry, you won't have \r\nto learn anything or do anything complicated... I'll tell you exactly how to get it set up and \r\nuse it. **I know it looks really long, but it's easy, trust me! **\r\n\r\nAlso anything relevant that you send me by email, Facebook, letter, etc, I can put on GitHub for \r\nyou. We could also record audio conversations and put those on there. We could also do like\r\nI did for my \"Forest Journal\" and just scan handwritten sheets. But for the most part I think \r\nit will be easiest to just write text documents on GitHub (this will also make it easier if \r\nwe want to put what we do in other formats like a website, etc.)\r\n\r\n##So here is how we do it (text me at any point if you have questions):\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://github.com/signup/free and create an account... _Actually, I just remembered;\r\nyou already have an account called \"Saronce\"_. So log in. Then click on \"Set Up Git\". \r\nThen click the green button that says **\"Download GitHub for Windows\"**. Open the file that \r\nwas downloaded and install GitHub.\r\n\r\n2.Once its done it should open up GitHub in a new window automatically, it might take a minute\r\nor two. Once GitHub is set up and you have logged in switch to your internet browser and\r\ngo to https://github.com/Sheldonfrith/sarahandsheldon and click **\"Fork\"** at the top right of the \r\npage. It will then take you to a page called \"yourusername\"/sarahandsheldon. You can look around \r\nhere if you want to but you **pretty much don't need to worry about this page if you don't want\r\nto.**\r\n\r\n3.Now switch back to the \"GitHub\" application that you set up earlier (if it is gone there \r\nshould be a \"GitHub\" icon on your desktop). Now, in the \"GitHub\" application, click on **\"refresh\"**\r\nin the top middle of the screen. You should now see the \"Repository\" (dont worry about what a \r\nrepository is) called \"yourusername\"/sarahandsheldon. Click on it and then **\"clone\"** it (there \r\nshould be a \"clone\" button next to its name). After you clone it it should show up under the \r\n\"local\" heading (on the left). **Double click on this one to open the repository.**\r\n\r\n4. So now you are in the main screen for our project. You only have to \"clone\" it the first time\r\nso all you really have to do is double click on its name once the program starts up from now on.\r\nThe next thing you should do is click **\"sync\"** (at the top) if it is available. This will make sure\r\nyour copy is the same as my copy so you can see what I have done so far. Now to actually start\r\ndoing things, haha!\r\n\r\n5. While in this screen click on \"Tools\" at the top and then from the drop down menu click on\r\n**\"open in explorer\"**. This will open a new window showing all the files that are in our project.\r\nThese files work like any other files on your computer and can be edited and accessed in \r\nthe exact same way. You will see a file called \".gitignore\" and \".gitattributes\" (and\r\nmaybe a folder called \".git\") don't worry about any of these and don't do anything to them. \r\nThey are just there so that the software works right and have nothing to do with our \r\nproject. \r\n\r\n6. So now you can explore what has been done so far... check what is in the folders... \r\nopen up all the files, etc. This is where we edit the project and add stuff; I'll come\r\nback to that later. \r\n\r\n*This next step only applies if you have actually changed something. If you were just looking \r\naround feel free to close \"GitHub\" right away. \r\n\r\n7. After you have done everything you want to the project (make sure you've saved any \r\nfiles you changed) go back to the \"GitHub\" application. On the left side of the screen, under\r\n\"# files to be commited\" you will see any files you changed listed labeled as \"new\". You can \r\nclick on the little arrows if you want and it will show you exactly what was changed in the \r\nfile. On the right there will be a yellow box labeled **\"uncommited changes\"**. So to save what \r\nyou just did to the internet where I can see it, etc, simply write a short message about what\r\nyou did (for example: \"added pictures of childhood teddy bears\" or whatever) and then press\r\n**\"COMMIT\"**. Now click **\"sync\"** at the top. It will take a little while but as soon as there are \r\nno \"unsynced commits\" (on the right of the screen) then all of your changes have been published\r\nto the internet!!! \r\n\r\n*And you can do this part as often as you want. Dont wait until you've got a \"final draft\" \r\nready or whatever, otherwise I won't be able to see what you're doing. \r\n\r\n8. So to see what I have done click \"sync\" (if you haven't done so recently). Then, on the right, under the heading **\"history\"** it will show all of the \"commits\" (changes) I have made (labeled as \"Sheldonfrith\"). Click on any of those \"commits\", and then on the left it will show you exactly what I changed (things in red were deleted, things in green were added). This is also how _I_ will see what _you_ have done. \r\n\r\n** *Also please be aware that either of us can delete what the other person has done if we want to. Lets agree to not do this please! **\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n#The Fun Part\r\n\r\nSo here is how you actually _DO THINGS_ on the project:\r\n\r\nTo **add a file** simply drag it, copy it, save it, etc, into the repository's folder; which will be called \"sarahandsheldon\". You can also right click anywhere in the folder and select \"NEW\" and the the file type you want to create.\r\n\r\nTo **add a _folder_** simply move an already existing one into the \"sarahandsheldon\" folder OR **right \r\nclick anywhere inside the folder and select \"NEW\">\"Folder\"** (then name it...).  \r\n\r\nDelete a file or folder the same way you normally do. \r\n\r\n*I think that we should try to keep everything as organised as possible so that it is easier for the \r\nother person to find stuff and it will make it easier if we want to make a website or something\r\nwith it later. What I mean by this is that we shouldn't have really huge files or folders; so instead of \r\nhaving one massive text file for our entire life we could have a separate text file for each year, or month, or whatever. Also we should not just put everything in one folder; we should organize it into subfolders. I have already started to do this, and I'm sure you would have done it anyways. \r\n\r\n##Text Editor \r\n\r\nSo for the actual \"content\" that we are writing it would be nice to have most, or all, of the pictures\r\nwe upload actually in _with_ the text. You were probably thinking that was how we were going to do it \r\nany ways. The problem is, though, that we **can't use Microsoft Word** or even Open Office. The reason for this is kinda technical but basically it will make it impossible to convert the files into a website or to read them with anything but Word! The best option would be **HTML** since that is what websites are written in anyways and it can be read by pretty much anything. Unfortunately it might be a pain in the ass for you to learn, although it is not nearly as complicated as a programming language. There is also **Markdown**. It works, on the technical level, exactly like HTML but it is way easier to use (its what I'm using right now to write this). Its still not really like Word at all but its very simple and if you wanted to you could learn how to use it in minutes. Basic **\"Plain Text\"/TXT/.txt** files are also good because they can easily be put into a website and can be read by pretty much any text-editor. However there is the huge drawback of not being able to add pictures and you can't really make it look pretty, AT ALL! \r\n\r\nSo ya, I guess I think Markdown is the best option. I'm not really sure what other options there are. \r\nIf you have any ideas let me know!\r\n\r\nTo use Markdown download MarkdownPad (http://markdownpad.com/) and install it. The screen on the right is what the document will look like on a website, the left is the part you are actually editing. All you really need to learn is things like \"**\" which makes a section of text bold, etc. Pretty much just write as you normally would until you have a problem or want to do something specific (like add a picture, make columns, or make a heading, etc) then just google how to do it or go to \"Help\">\"Official Markdown Syntax Guide\" (in MarkdownPad). I can help you out with Markdown if you want, call me. Also I am not just wanting to use Markdown so that I can be in a position of power or something like that... **I would prefer to use Word too**... its just that I would also really like to be able to do lots of stuff with the files we end up writing. Also Word files have the issue of going out of date (which HTML doesn't really) and I want to be able to read these files when I'm 80 in my holographic room on Mars!!! \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Adding Pictures, and an Example\r\n\r\nSo, assuming you download MarkdownPad, here is how we integrate pictures with our writing:\r\n\r\nSo to add pictures in HTML/Markdown you basically just make a link to the URL of the picture you want and then it shows up on your page. The problem is that the picture you want is probably just on your hard-drive and **doesn't have a URL**. So to solve this problem we have to use an internet picture hosting service... Ian recommended Flickr, cause it's free.\r\n\r\n So if you don't have a Flickr account make one, and then **add me as a friend/contact** so that we can see and use each other's pictures. Then upload the pictures you want to use. Then go to the specific picture you are trying to add and click on the drop-down menu above it which is labelled **\"share\"**. Then select the \"Grab the HTML/BBCode\" heading. Select the size you want the picture to be, and make sure that \"HTML\" is selected **not \"BBCode\"**. Then copy the text in the box (cntrl-c). Then go to your Markdown text document and paste the text you just copied wherever you want the picture to appear.\r\nThats it! The picture should then appear in the right screen in MarkdownPad (press f6 to see your document in your web browser).\r\n\r\nI have made a quick example document to show you an example of what this will look like. Its not super fancy or pretty, but it is clean and simple at least. To see my example **open the GitHub folder, open \"sarahandsheldon\",open \"Our Story\", and then open \"Example (macawpage1).md\" in MarkdownPad.** This is a good way of seeing what you actually have to type (in the left window) versus what it looks like (in the right window). If you want to see what the document will look like on the internet press \"f6\" (or click on the little globe at the top menu labelled **\"Render Markdown in Browser\"**)."}
