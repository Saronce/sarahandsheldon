HEY SARAH!!! THIS IS A "COMMENT", IT DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE "VIEWED" VERSION OF THIS FILE. IT IS A GOOD WAY OF LEAVING YOURSELF NOTES LIKE: "I'm not sure about this part of the text... I should come back and edit it later." GET THE IDEA?
TO WRITE A "COMMENT", AS OPPOSED TO WRITING NORMALLY, SIMPLY TYPE THE CHARACTERS "<!--", TYPE YOUR COMMENT, AND THEN TYPE "- - >" (but without the spaces) TO END THE COMMENT. ANYTHING AT ALL THAT IS IN BETWEEN "<!--" and "- - >" (without the spaces) IS CONSIDERED A COMMENT AND WILL NOT BE SHOWN IN A BROWSER.

BELOW YOU CAN SEE TWO EXAMPLES OF PICTURES I HAVE ADDED BY COPY/PASTING FROM FLICKR.

I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA IF WE BOTH WORKED ON THE SAME DOCUMENTS BUT DIFFERENTIATED OUR INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS SOMEHOW.... MY IDEA WAS THAT WE WILL EACH USE OUR OWN COLOR OF TEXT FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE WRITE. WE CAN ALSO SIGN WHAT WE WRITE WITH "-SHELDON" or "-SARAH" AT THE END OF IT. 

I HAVE CHOSEN "darkgreen" AS MY COLOUR, HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T MIND? TO MAKE A PIECE OF TEXT A DIFFENT COLOUR YOU HAVE TO PUT A SPECIAL "TAG" AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PIECE OF TEXT AND THEN ANOTHER "TAG" AT THE END (THE SAME IDEA AS FOR "COMMENTS"). AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR SECTION OF TEXT WRITE <font color="yourchosencolor"> AND AT THE END WRITE </font> .... THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT. CALL ME IF YOU WANT HELP.

PS. Remember to try "f6"

<font color="darkgreen">This is the **first page** from a shiny green scrapbook of mine that has a macaw on the front (henceforth refered to as the "**macaw scrapbook**"). 

The top picture is a view up the hill from our house (roughly east, so I guess its a **sun_rise_**). In the middle of the picture you can see white goal-posts; that was our soccer field. The prominent palm tree is actually a coconut tree... although I don't ever remember actually getting any coconuts from it. 

The bottom picture is hard to make out, but it is a view in the opposite direction. The picture taker is standing on the road in front of our house looking west at the **sun*set***. Those very vague houses you can kind of make out right in the middle were the "Indian Houses" (except for the larger one on the left which was an abandoned old library). Yes... We called the Native People _Indians_. We didn't think it was rude. I don't really feel bad about it. Oh that reminds me: We used to call our house the "White House" (because it was painted white). **How many people can truthfully say that they grew up in the White House?** Haha.

<font color="blue">Sheldon and I never actually made it up that coconut tree. But it was either our friend **Marcus Wild** or **Ben Bunn** who did. He brought back a coconut for us. 

The soccer field in the background is one of the most frequent places that I dream about. I don't know why this is because I don't ever remember playing soccer on it. Dad used to **wheelie the length of the field on his dirtbike**. The jungle behind the soccer field acted as a wall. Beyond it was a mystery to me, I never even dared to go within three feet of it. Except to the southeast side (near the right of the picture). That part of the jungle was behind the electircal shop, and one day there was a big forest fire. Dad and Sheldon and I went into the jungle and beat the fire out with our t-shirts. Mom was freaking out (I think she called the fire trucks too), which made the fire seem bigger than it probably was.

I have yet to feel as close to a **superhero** as I did that day. Nearing the end of the fire Dad came running out through the smoke as a tree fell over behind him. Is there a more **cool** image? My hands were sooted and I made a point to rub them accross my sweaty forehead-**the dirtier the better**. Why couldn't I have been injured or had my hair singed? I needed some sort of proof to the fact that I had just helped put out a forest fire. I probably tried to keep the ruined shirt too.

The second picture shows a place I rarely went. The indian houses were mysterious. One day we went in one of them and played Dodge Ball. The floor was concrete and the walls were exposed red clay bricks. I'm sure every child has the memory of the **sound of that red dodgeball bouncing on cement**.
